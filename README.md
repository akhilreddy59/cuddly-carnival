# Frontend & Full-Stack Daily Practice

This repository documents my **daily hands-on practice** while building strong fundamentals in **frontend and backend web development**.  
The focus is on understanding **how things work under the hood**, not just using tools or frameworks.

Each day includes:

- Notes written in my own words
- Code examples and experiments
- Output predictions and debugging practice

This repository reflects **consistent learning, logical thinking, and real implementation**.

- Hoisting behavior of `var`, `let`, `const`, and functions
- Temporal Dead Zone
- Why different declarations behave differently

**Day 3 – Scope Chain & Lexical Scope**

- How JavaScript resolves variables
- Lexical scoping and nested scopes
- Practical implications in real code

**Day 4 – Closures**

- How closures are formed
- Practical use cases like data privacy
- Relationship between closures and scope chain

**Day 5 – `this` Keyword**

- How `this` is determined based on function invocation
- Common pitfalls with `this`
- Understanding context binding

**Day 6 – Output Prediction & Debugging**

- Predicting outputs before running code
- Tracing execution flow manually
- Improving debugging mindset

**Day 7 – Revision & Concept Linking**

- Connecting execution context, scope, and closures

### 🔹 Objects, Prototypes & Memory

**Day 8 – JavaScript Objects & Property Lookup**

- Object structure and key-value storage
- How JavaScript looks up properties
- Introduction to prototype-based behavior

**Day 9 – Prototypes & Inheritance**

- Prototype chain traversal
- Method resolution through prototypes
- Understanding inheritance in JavaScript without theory-heavy abstractions

**Day 9 - new  keyword internals**

## Strucutre
Till day 9 the repo hos no proper structure 
But from Day 10 proper file and structure will be available 
This are my Learnings , i daily push my learnings in github for more practice and to gain experience in github
